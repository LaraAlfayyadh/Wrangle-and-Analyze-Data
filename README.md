# Udacity_Data_Analyst_project4

## Wrangle and Analyze Data

## by (Lara Alfayyadh)

### I completed this project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## Project Overview
> In this project, we will go through the process of data wrangling and work on gathering and define the quality, issues and tidiness of the data. 

## Gathering Data
> This project contains three datasets:â€¨Twitter archive (csv file) Image predictions for dogs (tsv file), download it programmatically as a URL by request library. Twitter info which is on twitter servers encompassed in Twitter archive, we will download it by Tweepy library. 


## Assessing Data 
> Assess them visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues. Detect and document at least eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues 

### Quality issues: 
#### For twitter_archive 
> 1. Erroneous datatypes: shall be DateTime rather than timestamp.
> 2. Incorrect dog names there are names like 'a', 'an', 'the', 'none'.
> 3. Capitalize the first letter of the name.
> 4. The favourites and retweets columns should be converted to int datatype.
> 5. Since the tweet_id will not be used in the calculation, it should be a string instead of an integer.
> 6. For the rating_numerator and rating_denominator should be converted to float rather than int.

#### For image_predictions
> 7. Change the source to be more readable.


#### For json_tweet
> 8. Since the tweet_id will not be used in the calculation, it should be a string instead of an integer.


### Tidiness issues:
> 1. The doge types (doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) are in separated columns we have to merge it in one column called dog_types.
> 2. Matching the data in twitter_archive dataset and tweet-JSON because the data is sorted in separated tables.

## Cleaning Data
> - Merge the json_tweet_clean and image_predictions_clean tables to the twitter_archive_clean table, both joining on tweet_id.
> - Convert timestamp to datetime.
> - Show the inccorected names of dog then put it as "None" rows.
> - Capitalize the first letter in the name.
> - Change the columns name for to make it readable 'p1', 'p2', 'p3' , 'p1_conf', 'p2_conf'
and 'p3_conf'.
> - The favorites and retweets columns should be converted to int datatype.
> - Change the tweet_id from int to str.
> - Drop useless columns.
> - The doge types are in separated columns we have to merge it in one column called
dog_types.
> - Change the source instead of links to words to be more readable.
